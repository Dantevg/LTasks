\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Many thanks go out to my supervisor, Peter Achten. Not only for guiding me throughout the process and providing continuous valuable feedback on my writing, but also for helping me understand TOP and helping me fix errors in my Clean code.
I also want to thank my parents and my friends for their support.
