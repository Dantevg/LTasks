Task Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm centered around \textit{tasks}. Its implementations are written in the functional language Clean. Lua is a procedural language that is very different to Clean. This thesis describes the design space that appears when implementing TOP in Lua. We create a proof-of-concept implementation of TOP in Lua and show that it has some benefits over its counterpart in Clean.
