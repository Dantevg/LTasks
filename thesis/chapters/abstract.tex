Task Oriented Programming (TOP) is a programming paradigm centered around \textit{tasks}. Its implementations are written in the functional language Clean. Lua is a procedural language that is very different to Clean. This thesis explores the design space that appears when implementing TOP in Lua. We create a proof-of-concept implementation of TOP in Lua and show that Lua has some benefits over Clean for implementing TOP.
