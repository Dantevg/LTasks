\section{TOP in Lua}\label{section-top-lua}
Lua's coroutines can turn out to be very useful for modelling tasks. Metatables can be used for adding behaviour or meta-information to otherwise simple (or empty) tables. This can change how editors are displayed visually for instance. 
% The proof-of-concept should make use of the features that Lua offers, being an interpreted dynamically typed language. Especially the features/use-cases that are not present/possible with the current implementations iTasks and mTasks.
