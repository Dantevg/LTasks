\chapter{Research}\label{research}
This chapter, or series of chapters, delves into all technical details that are
required to \emph{prove} your scientific hypothesis.
It should be sufficiently detailed and precise in order for any fellow computing scientist student to be able to \emph{repeat}
your research and therewith establish the same results / conclusions that you have obtained.
Please note that, in order to improve readability of your thesis, you can put a part of this information also in one or
more appendices (see Appendix \ref{appendix}).
