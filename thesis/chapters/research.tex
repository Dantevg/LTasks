\chapter{Research}\label{research}
% This chapter, or series of chapters, delves into all technical details that are
% required to \emph{prove} your scientific hypothesis.
% It should be sufficiently detailed and precise in order for any fellow computing scientist student to be able to \emph{repeat}
% your research and therewith establish the same results / conclusions that you have obtained.
% Please note that, in order to improve readability of your thesis, you can put a part of this information also in one or
% more appendices (see Appendix \ref{appendix}).

There are many design decisions of TOP in Lua to be explored, resulting from the major differences between Clean and Lua. This research explores the design space and creates a proof-of-concept of TOP in Lua based on these decisions. The proof-of-concept is complete, when:
\begin{itemize}
    \item it features a basic implementation of tasks
    \item these tasks can be composed sequentially and in parallel (both ``and'' and ``or''), while making use of observable task values.
    \item it has a way of interaction with users (editors), and some form of user interface that is automatically generated. Minimally, the editors should be able to model tables, strings, numbers and booleans.
    % \item it has shared data sources that can be modified by these editors.
\end{itemize}

The concept of shared data sources and exceptions in TOP (\S \ref{section-top-task-value}) are out of scope for this bachelor thesis.

In the next section, we think about how to meaningfully work with the dynamic type system of Lua. After that, we look how we can represent tasks (\S \ref{section-task-values}) and task types (\S \ref{section-type-representation}). Section \ref{section-combinators} takes a look at task combinators, we discuss user interfaces in section \ref{section-editors-ui} and lastly we discuss LTasks (\S \ref{section-ltasks}).
