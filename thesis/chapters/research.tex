\chapter{Research}\label{research}
% This chapter, or series of chapters, delves into all technical details that are
% required to \emph{prove} your scientific hypothesis.
% It should be sufficiently detailed and precise in order for any fellow computing scientist student to be able to \emph{repeat}
% your research and therewith establish the same results / conclusions that you have obtained.
% Please note that, in order to improve readability of your thesis, you can put a part of this information also in one or
% more appendices (see Appendix \ref{appendix}).

\dots\todo{complete}

There are many design decisions of TOP in Lua to be explored, resulting from the major differences between Clean and Lua. This research explores the design space and creates a proof-of-concept of TOP in Lua based on these decisions. The proof-of-concept is complete, when:
\begin{itemize}
    \item it features a basic implementation of tasks
    \item these tasks can be composed sequentially and in parallel (both ``and'' and ``or'').
    \item it has a way of interaction with users (editors), and some form of user interface that is automatically generated. Minimally, the editors should be able to model tables, strings, numbers and booleans.
    % \item it has shared data sources that can be modified by these editors.
\end{itemize}

The concept of shared data sources and exceptions in TOP (\S \ref{section-top-task-value}) are out of scope for this thesis.
